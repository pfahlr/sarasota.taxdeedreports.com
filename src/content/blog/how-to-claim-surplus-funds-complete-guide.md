When properties are sold at tax deed auctions in Sarasota County, Florida, the final bid often exceeds what was owed in taxes. The leftover balance is known as a **surplus fund**, and in many cases, that money legally belongs to the former owner—or their heirs, lienholders, or creditors.

If you're a real estate investor, surplus recovery specialist, or someone trying to claim uncollected funds, this article breaks down **everything you need to know about Sarasota surplus funds**—and how to collect them.

## 💡 What Are Surplus Funds?

When the Clerk of Court sells a property due to unpaid taxes, the opening bid covers what the county is owed. But if the property sells for more than that minimum, the difference becomes **surplus funds**.

For example:

* Opening bid (what’s owed): \$8,000
* Final sale price: \$82,000
* **Surplus funds available**: \$74,000

This money can be claimed by qualifying parties, most often:

* Former property owners
* Lienholders (e.g., mortgage companies, cities)
* Estates and heirs

## 📍 Where to Find Sarasota Surplus Fund Data

Surplus funds are public record, but **finding them can be complicated**. Here’s where to look:

* **Sarasota Clerk of Court – Tax Deed Department**
  Lists active and completed tax deed cases, but you must manually open each one for surplus data.

* **Surplus Notice Letters & Court Docs**
  These include case-specific data like owner names, claim instructions, and surplus balances—but you must download and parse multiple PDFs.

* **RealTDM System**
  Sarasota uses RealTDM to publish surplus fund data and associated documents, but it’s not structured or searchable.
