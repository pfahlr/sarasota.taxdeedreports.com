When a property in Sarasota County is sold at a **tax deed auction**, the sale price often exceeds the amount needed to cover unpaid property taxes and auction costs. The extra money is called **surplus funds**—and it’s a potential windfall for former property owners, heirs, or lienholders.

This guide explains **what Sarasota surplus funds are, how the claim process works, the timelines you need to know, and how tools like [TaxDeedReports.com](https://taxdeedreports.com) can make the process faster and easier**.

## 💡 What Are Sarasota Surplus Funds?

Under Florida Statute §197.582, surplus funds are the **amount left over after**:

1. Paying delinquent property taxes  
2. Covering auction fees and court costs

For example:

| Auction Detail                   | Amount      |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Opening bid (taxes owed + costs) | $9,500      |
| Winning bid                      | $81,000     |
| **Surplus funds**                | **$71,500** |

These funds are **not kept by the county**—they are held temporarily by the Clerk and Comptroller and are claimable by eligible parties.

## 🏛 Who Can Claim Sarasota Surplus Funds?

**Priority for claims is set by Florida law**:

1. **Governmental lienholders** – e.g., municipalities, IRS, state agencies  
2. **Non-governmental lienholders** – mortgage lenders, condo associations  
3. **Owner(s) of record at the time of the tax deed sale**  
4. **Heirs or estates** – if the owner is deceased  

Other interested parties (like judgment creditors) may also have rights, depending on case specifics.

## 📍 Where to Find Sarasota Surplus Fund Data

Surplus fund records are **public**, but they’re scattered across multiple sources:

- **Sarasota Clerk of Court – Tax Deed Department**  
  Case records list surplus balances, but require opening each case file individually.

- **RealTDM Auction Platform**  
  Sarasota publishes tax deed sales here, including surplus balances and linked court documents. The catch? The data isn’t structured or easily searchable.

- **Surplus Notices & Property Information Reports**  
  Mailed to parties after the sale. Include claim instructions, deadlines, and surplus amounts.

> **Pro Tip:** Manually combing through PDFs is time-consuming. [TaxDeedReports.com](https://taxdeedreports.com) compiles all surplus data into searchable CSVs with linked documents.
