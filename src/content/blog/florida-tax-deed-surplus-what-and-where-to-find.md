If a property owner fails to pay their property taxes in Florida, the county can ultimately sell the property at a **tax deed auction** to recover the unpaid taxes. But here’s where the opportunity lies:  
When the winning bid **exceeds the amount owed** for taxes, interest, and fees, the excess is known as **surplus funds** — money that, in most cases, belongs to the former owner or other lienholders.

### How Surplus Funds Are Created

1. **Tax Certificates** – Counties first sell tax certificates to investors. These certificates represent unpaid property taxes and accrue interest until redeemed or converted into a tax deed application.
2. **Tax Deed Application** – If taxes remain unpaid after a set period, the certificate holder can apply for the property to be sold at a public auction.
3. **Auction Sale** – The property is auctioned to the highest bidder. The opening bid usually covers:
   - Unpaid taxes
   - Clerk and advertising fees
   - Any municipal liens or costs  
   Any amount bid **above** this opening bid becomes the surplus.
4. **Surplus Distribution** – After the sale, the county clerk calculates the surplus and holds it in trust while notifying parties with potential claims.

### The Process Varies by County

While the core steps are similar across Florida, **county-specific rules** can affect timelines, claimant priorities, and the ease of finding surplus cases.  

#### County Process Quick Reference

| County     | Surplus Posting Method | Claim Deadline | Notes |
|------------|------------------------|----------------|-------|
| **Sarasota** | Detailed surplus postings on Clerk’s tax deed auction site with document access | 120 days | Notices mailed to interested parties; surplus clearly indicated in auction results |
| **Lee**     | Surplus information posted alongside completed sale details | 120 days | Case log PDFs often contain surplus info; documents are downloadable online |
| **Pinellas**| Surplus is flagged in auction history table | 120 days | Strong document indexing makes case research easier; surplus notices available as PDFs |
| **Hillsborough** | Surplus list updated weekly | 120 days | Parties must file surplus claim forms; online filing available |
| **Brevard** | Surplus info only visible in final sale summary | 120 days | Minimal surplus labeling — requires reviewing sale prices vs. opening bids |
| **Manatee** | Separate “Surplus Funds” page maintained by Clerk | 120 days | Simple interface but fewer linked property documents |

*Note: The 120-day deadline is typical but should always be verified with the county Clerk’s office.*

### Challenges in Locating Surplus Opportunities

Manually finding surplus cases is time-consuming:
- You must navigate individual county Clerk of Court systems, many of which are slow and inconsistent.
- The surplus status of a case may not be clearly indicated without reading through case logs.
- Property details are often stored separately in Property Appraiser systems, requiring cross-referencing parcel numbers.

This fragmented process can make it easy to miss lucrative opportunities — unless you have the right tools.

- Which cases have surplus potential  
- The exact parties involved  
- How to reach them **before competitors do**
